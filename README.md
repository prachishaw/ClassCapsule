## 🧠 Overview

**ClassCapsule** is a web application built using **Angular**. It aims to simplify and organize academic life for students, teachers, administrators, and alumni. The app allows users to manage assignments, view schedules, check reports, and perform essential academic tasks from one platform.

The app is currently under development and already includes several useful features like a dashboard, calendar, reports, assignments, and user authentication. In the future, we plan to add a separate section for **alumni** where they can connect with students and the administration. This platform is meant to help everyone in an educational institution stay connected, informed, and updated.

The app has a login system where different users can log in based on their role:

Each role sees a different dashboard with options made just for them.

### 🧭 Sidebar Navigation
The app has a clean sidebar for easy navigation. It includes links to:
- Dashboard

The sidebar is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile.

Teachers can create and post assignments. Students can view them based on their schedule. This feature helps organize course work and manage time better.

This makes it easy to follow academic performance.

## 🧪 Testing and Performance

We have tested the app on multiple browsers and screen sizes to ensure it works well everywhere. It loads fast, and the components adjust automatically based on the user's screen.

The app is easy to maintain and update because it uses modular code. Each feature is in its own folder, making it simple to fix bugs or add new tools.
